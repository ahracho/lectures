# lectures
It's a repository for lecture notes I've used in my lecture last few years.
Basically, most of lectures are covering the basis of each programming language itself.
But for python, tried to focus on how python and its useful external packages (e.g. numpy and pandas) can be used for data analysis.

Lecture notes can be updated as I expand my lecture coverage.
